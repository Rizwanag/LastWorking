Configuration Notes
The DispatcherServlet processes requests as follows:

*)The WebApplicationContext is searched for and bound in the request as an attribute that the controller and other elements in the process can use. 
It is bound by default under the DispatcherServlet.WEB_APPLICATION_CONTEXT_ATTRIBUTE key.

*)The locale resolver is bound to the request to let elements in the process resolve the locale to use when processing the request (rendering the view, 
preparing data, and so on). If you do not need locale resolving, you do not need the locale resolver.

*)The theme resolver is bound to the request to let elements such as views determine which theme to use. If you do not use themes, you can ignore it.

*)If you specify a multipart file resolver, the request is inspected for multiparts. If multiparts are found, the request is wrapped in a 
MultipartHttpServletRequest for further processing by other elements in the process. See Multipart Resolver for further information about 
multipart handling.

*)An appropriate handler is searched for. If a handler is found, the execution chain associated with the handler (preprocessors, postprocessors, 
and controllers) is executed in order to prepare a model or rendering. Alternatively, for annotated controllers, the response can be rendered 
(within the HandlerAdapter) instead of returning a view.

*)If a model is returned, the view is rendered. If no model is returned (maybe due to a preprocessor or postprocessor intercepting the request, 
perhaps for security reasons), no view is rendered, because the request could already have been fulfilled.
